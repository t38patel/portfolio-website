# portfolio-website
This is my personal portfolio website. This is primarily to showcase my projects that I've done in the field of blockchain and web3, since that is the industry that I see myself pursuing. The design of the portfolio is called "glassmorphism", and there are many modern-looking themes out there like this one. This look was inspired by TheWebShala on Patreon.
